django-uslug
================

A custom slug app for Django, that guarantees Double(u) for (Uniqueness & Unicode handling)

Most of the code is originally by snippet http://www.djangosnippets.org/snippets/369/
Improved slightly to handle unique slugs and unicode chars and packaged by Val L33.

Patches welcome: http://bitbucket.org/un33k/django-uuslug

Usage
=====

If you want a worry free slug-er, then this is for you.
It handles unicode and it produces unique slugs.

Here what you need to do:
        
1. Stick ``"uuslug"`` in ``INSTALLED_APPS``, Then import it like: from uuslug import uuslug as slugify
            
That's it.

String Test Example
=====

        from uuslug import uuslug as slugify
        
        s = "This is a test ---"
        r = slugify(s)
        self.assertEquals(r, "this-is-a-test")

        s = 'C\'est déjà l\'été.'
        r = slugify(s)
        self.assertEquals(r, "c-est-deja-l-ete")
        
        s = 'Nín hǎo. Wǒ shì zhōng guó rén'
        r = slugify(s)
        self.assertEquals(r, "nin-hao-wo-shi-zhong-guo-ren")

        s = '影師嗎'
        r = slugify(s)
        self.assertEquals(r, "ying-shi-ma")     
        

Object Example
=====
    Override your object's save method with something like this
    
    from uuslug import uuslug as slugify

    def save(self, *args, **kwargs):
        self.slug = slugify(self.name, instance=self)
        super(State, self).save(*args, **kwargs)
        
    if you had two "names" as John & John, the slug for the first John would be "john" & 
    for the second John it would be "john-1"

ToDo
=====
add templatetags
add testcase for templatetags
add fixture to test uuslug on objects
